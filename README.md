# ChatRun

ChatRun is the solution to the personal disconnect that current social media has
unintentionally created. The over-emphasis on globalization in todayâ€™s social media has
buried the importance and significance of local connections. Although other social
media provides a way of maintaining older relationships, it does not encourage new
personal and local connections. Our goal is to connect like-minded individuals both
professionally and casually on a local level.
